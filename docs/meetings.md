# Meetings with David

## MVP
David was shown the MVP.
He was impressed by the site layout and the general mock up of the app.
He suggested changes to the Site view to be easier to read and suggested
the cards on the dashboard to be shorter width.

## Beta release
David was shown the Beta release.

### Site page
- David was impressed by the new layout
- Liked the Card design
- Suggested adding a green tick to the top right corner if site is complete

### Dashboard page
- He liked the new card design which is consistent with the site page
- Preferred the look of using the Tick/Bacon/Cross to indicate completeness
- Looking forward to the more details being implemented
- Suggested its not necessary to add detailed view to KPIs such as site visits
    but noted that this could be used to show *details of the site visit* and
    the number of visits over time

### Map page
- Thought it was a good idea to have a map page
- Suggested centring the map to the average location of sites
- Thought good for finding sites if have lots of sites

### Settings page
- Told David the settings page is waiting for the backend and frontend to be connected.
- Explained the gist of what settings will be available 
  - Standard credentials settings
  - API tokens
  - Edit user permission for admins

### API token discussion
- David was interested in the security regarding API tokens
- Told him that a user will only be able to make tokens for sites they have
- Tokens will only be able to be at most an inclusive subset of the user permissions
- The main point of tokens is to allow automatic upload from sites
- Tokens could be used by clients to fetch stats from the dashboard into scripts
- Tokens are revocable and linked to a users profile

### Misc
- Felt the app looked very clean and professional
- Liked the colour scheme 
- Discussed the fact the app is available at lidar.icedcoffee.dev
- Informed that HotJar will be informed to analyse UX
- Asked for him to demo it to a few persons and survey will be sent out

### Future development
- Connect front and backend
- Build the informative views
- Design settings menu
- Add KPIs
- Add permission system
